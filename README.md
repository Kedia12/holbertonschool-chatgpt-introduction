Debugging Project - Python Factorial

Overview

This project is part of a specialized module on integrating AI into everyday coding practices. The focus of this task is debugging, where we leverage ChatGPT to identify and fix errors in Python code.

The specific task involves a Python script that calculates the factorial of a number. The original script contains a bug that causes an infinite loop. By debugging it, you’ll gain hands-on experience in AI-assisted problem-solving and improve your understanding of Python programming fundamentals.

Objectives

Understand how AI can assist in debugging code efficiently.
Identify and correct logical errors in Python scripts.
Learn best practices for writing correct and maintainable code.

Task

Fix the factorial.py script so that it correctly prints the factorial of a number provided as a command-line argument.
